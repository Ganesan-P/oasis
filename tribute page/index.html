                <h2>FIRST PROGRAMMER</h2>
                <P> <b>Ada Lovelace</b> born Augusta Ada Byron in 1815, was a remarkable mathematician and writer who made an indelible mark on the world of computing. She is widely regarded as the world's first computer programmer, having written the world's first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Lovelace's pioneering work was done in collaboration with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine, a groundbreaking mechanical general-purpose computer design. Her notes on the engine not only included detailed explanations but also the first computer algorithm, which could be considered the precursor to modern computer programming. Ada Lovelace's visionary insights into the potential of computers laid the foundation for the digital age, and her contributions continue to inspire and shape the field of computer science to this day.</P>
